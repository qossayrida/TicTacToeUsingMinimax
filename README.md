# Tic Tac Toe Using Minimax

This project aims to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game using the minimax algorithm. The game will provide different scenarios including play against an AI that makes random moves, a two-player mode, and the ultimate challenge against the minimax-based unbeatable AI.

## How to use
Starting the Game: Launch the game to reach the main menu. Choose from ***Easy Mode*** for a less challenging AI, ***Advanced Mode*** for a tougher AI opponent, or ***Two Players Mode*** for a classic game between two human players. After selecting your desired mode, click 'Start' to begin the game or 'Exit' to close the application.
